Hello, Iâ€™m Pedro.

I'm a UI developer interested in design systems, jamstack, user/dev experience and under engineering.

I'm currently doing UI/DX at [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me) ðŸŒˆ to help create the world's friendliest wallet.



Previously, I worked at [Modulz](https://modulz.app) as a DX Engineer. Where I co-created [Radix](https://radix-ui.com), designed the [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) API and led the developer community.



I was born in Brazil, raised in the UK and now living in Barcelona with my little family.
