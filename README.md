Hello, Iâ€™m Pedro.

I'm a UI developer based in Barcelona. I'm interested in design systems, web3, user/dev experience and under engineering.

I'm currently working at [Raycast](https://raycast.com) as a DX Engineer to grow its developer community.


Previously, I worked at [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me), where I focused on [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com). Before that, I co-created [Radix](https://radix-ui.com), [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) and led their developer community.
