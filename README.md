Hello, Iâ€™m Pedro.

I'm a UI developer based in Barcelona. I'm interested in design systems, web3, user/dev experience and under engineering.

I'm currently doing UI/DX at [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me) ðŸŒˆ to help create the world's friendliest wallet.

Previously, I worked at [Modulz](https://modulz.app) as a DX Engineer. Where I co-created [Radix](https://radix-ui.com), designed the [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) API and led the developer community.
