Hello, Iâ€™m Pedro.

I'm a UI developer interested in design systems, jamstack, user/dev experience and under engineering.

I work at [Modulz](https://modulz.app) as a DX Engineer. Helping close the gap between designâ€”dev and focusing on [Radix](https://radix-ui.com) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev).

I was born in Brazil, raised in the UK and now living in Barcelona with my little family.
